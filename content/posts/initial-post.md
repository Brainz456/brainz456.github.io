## A Brief Introduction

Heyo, my name is **Ysbryd** (pronounced Us-brid, meaning Spirit in Welsh). 
I'm a non-binary trans woman (*She/They - Hi/Nhw*) from Cymru (Wales) and I'm really into all things technological.

I've recently gotten into the perma-computing movement and as a result, have started this small blog to record my thoughts, ideas, and projects; as well as creating a way for people to contact me.

This blog will likely be an incredibly informal place, with the topics ranging from current hobbies to hopefully generating technical pieces over time. 

### A little about my background
Ever since I was young, I've been drawn to the aesthetics of the early days of the internet. I've toyed with the idea of carving out my own small segment of cyberspace, aiming to connect with likeminded individuals.
I've worked in the cyber security industry for several years now and have spent some of this time within academia.
I have mostly specialised in the industrial sector, protecting services such as critical national infrastructure, and healthcare systems.
While some of that may appear across this blog, it will be sparse as I aim to focus on my personal creative efforts.

I am currently reading a few different books on operating system design, language design and implementation, and also a short crash course book on the UXN programming language (more to come in another blog post shortly!). I'll probably write a few pieces on these in the next coming days/weeks.
