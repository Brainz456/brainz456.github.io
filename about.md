Hi! If you're reading this then welcome to this digital collection of thoughts and ideas that I am attemtping to capture!
So just who am I? Well, I'm Ysbryd (Us-brid), a non-binary Trans Woman from rainy South Wales. I've been absolutely captivated by technology from the moment I could crawl and unsurprisingly this resulted in a career in software development. I started in the cyber-security industry but recently have started to become jaded by so many significant technologies appearing that aggressively consume limited resources at such an alarming rate. 

After this realisation, I started to research alternative approaches to technology and became enraptured with the concept of solar punk and the design space of Perma-Computing. This research pushed me to consider writing down my findings and thinking about producing my own systems that could alter my own lifestyle. 

So if you like the idea of anything I've said above, then please enjoy reading through the posts here. I can't promise they'll be frequent, but they'll be honest writing from myself; and perhaps they'll show you something you hadn't quite considered before!
